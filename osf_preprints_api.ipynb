            "  \"description\": \"Parkinsonism is a degenerative neurological syndrome characterised by dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia. Despite ages of research, there is still lack of holistic and side-effect-free therapy for the disease. Nigella sativa is a multi-potent plant known for its historical and scientifically proven therapeutic potentials in the brain and other body organs. Despite the validity debates on the use of BALB/c mice strains in the modelling of Parkinsonism using MPTP, this study re-appraised the sensitivity versus resistance of the BALB/c mice strain to MPTP and further investigated the possible neuro-thrapeutic role of Nigella sativa oil (NSO) in the Parkinsonic endophenotypes elicited by MPTP in the BALB/c strain. Body weights, relative brain weights, striatal dopamine, striatal neuron density and recognition memory were studied in thirty-two (32) male albino mice, weighing between 18g -25g. They were divided equally into Control (administered with normal feed for 5 days), MPTP (administered with 18mg/kg MPTP  i.p for 5 days), NS (administered with 1ml/kgbw NSO p.o. for 5 days), and NS+MPTP (administered with 1ml/kgbw NSO p.o. followed by 18mg/kg MPTP i.p for 5 days). Recognition memory was assayed through Novel Object Recognition test (NORT), and the animals were weighed and euthanised 24 hours after last administration. The brains were excised and the striatum assayed neurochemically for dopamine and illustrated histologically for neuronal density using the H&amp;E stain. Parkinsonic traits such as mild tremor, significant down-regulation of dopamine and striatal neurons (p&lt;0.05) were recorded in the BALB/c mice administered with MPTP only, confirming MPTP-sensitivity for these features. However, significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in appetite, body weight, brain-body weight ratio, and recognition memory was also recorded in the MPTP-administered mice, though Nigella sativa was significantly prophylactic against the negative Parkinsonic features, and \\u2018moderative\\u2019 of the up-regulations induced by MPTP. While this suggests selective MPTP sensitivity and resistance in BALB/c strains, this study recommends the investigation of possible beneficial potentials of MPTP as observed. The research was conducted in conformance with the Animal Research Ethics Committee (AREC) guidelines of the Olabisi Onabanjo University.\",\n",

The paper unpacks the implication of economic sanctions for the maintenance of robust academic systems capable of addressing national development goals. We show how sanctions place \\u201cinvisible barriers\\u201d limiting access to necessary resources and curtailing their effective use. Furthermore, the impact of sanctions persists long after they are formally lifted. To develop our argument, we draw on a national survey of Sudanese academics focused on the impact of 20 years of economic sanctions on their work.  It identifies key areas of academic research and education that have been impacted by international sanctions.  It also discusses how the 2017 lifting of these sanctions is unlikely to overcome the long-term implications of the sanctions on academia. The paper concludes by problematising the current interpretation of jus post bellum, or moral behaviour after conflict.  It suggests that the responsibility to make reparations in the form of support for academic systems applies to countries who impose economic sanctions.\",\n",

In this study it is argued that the long-term effects of double-talk of donors, who openly promote democracy and freedom but covertly follow overriding hidden interest, are a neglected source of failure of civic protest and democratic revolutions in autocratic regimes. The differing outcome of \\u2018democratic revolutions\\u2019 in Togo and Burkina Faso \\u2013 both \\u2018aid darlings\\u2019 for decades - serves to substantiate this thesis. A systematic and holistic consideration is necessary for an unbiased evaluation of the hidden adverse impact of aid on collective action at the grass-roots.

The legislative elections of 20 December 2018, boycotted by the major opposition parties, resulted in an easy victory of the ruling party, however without the expected constitutional amendment majority. Therefore, the prime minister and his cabinet were replaced. The local elections, crucial for democratization at the grass-roots, but postponed time and again since 1987, were again postponed in December 2018 sine die. Economic growth remained stable at about 5% per annum. Public investment in infrastructure (e. g. roads, harbour) and increases in agricultural productivity, notably of export crops, had been the key drivers of economic growth. Moreover, money-laundering, illegal money transfers and trafficking grew alarmingly.

The demand for political alternance, initiated by institutional and electoral reforms, constituted the major contentious issue between the government and the challengers of the Gnassingb\\u00e9 regime throughout the survey period. An alliance of opposition parties and civil society groups organized peaceful demonstrations in opposition to the regime, which were often violently suppressed. Civil society organizations and representatives of the Christian church supported the demands of the opposition. The legislative elections of 20 December 2018, boycotted by the major opposition parties, resulted in an easy victory of the ruling party. The local elections, crucial for democratization at the grass-roots, but postponed time and again since 1987, were again postponed in December 2018 sine die. The human rights record of the government has improved but remains poor. Despite undeniable improvements to the framework and appearance of the regime's key institutions during the review period, democracy remains far from complete. However, the international community, notably Togo\\u2019s African peers, the AU and ECOWAS, followed a \\u2018laissez-faire\\u2019 approach in the interests of regional stability and their national interests in dealing with Togo. Economic growth remained stable at about 5% per annum. Public investment in infrastructure (e.g. roads, harbour) and increases in agricultural productivity, notably of export crops, had been the key drivers of economic growth. However, growth remains vulnerable to external shocks and the climate and has not been inclusive. Positive growth was overshadowed by increasing inter-personal and regional inequality as well as an increase in extreme poverty. Moreover, money-laundering, illegal money transfers and trafficking grew alarmingly. The business climate improved considerably nevertheless. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  R\\u00c9SUM\\u00c9:: Le clan Gnassingb\\u00e9 dirige le pays depuis 1967.

If at all, mostly indirect general effects were declared, both concerning the former British Empire in Africa and a fortifori for the former French colonies as well. Yet, the range of possible Brexit effect is impressive. It spreads from direct influence on farm-gate cocoa-prices in the CFA-currency regions and subsequent percussions on the state budget of these countries, over more indirect effects, e.g. on the cooperation between CEMAC, WAEMU and the EU concerning EDF-programs of which Great Britain has been a major contributor so far, as well as enforced re-negotiation of controversial EPAs, to the revival of progressive social networks in Francophone Africa. The latter are already demanding more political and economic sovereignty, for example with respect to the increasingly anachronistic F CFA currency. Yet, in view of the lack of countervailing power of Britain within the EU in the case of Brexit, the murky network of Fran\\u00e7afrique could be re-vitalized and consolidated as well. This impacts also on the revival of the long-standing controversy on the ill-adapted and increasingly anachronistic F CFA. Last, but not least, British application for EU membership had been vetoed two times by France in 1963 and November 1967. Arguably, this veto has direct links to the British Brexit vote of 2016. African activists already demand a genuine African debate and a referendum on these issues similar to the Brexit vote. More generally, the Brexit will also impact negatively on acquired ethics concerning popular participation, both in Europe and in Africa.\",\n",

Die Bandbreite der m\\u00f6glichen Brexit-Effekte ist jedoch auch hier beeindruckend, bis hin zur Wiederbelebung progressiver sozial-politischer Netzwerke im frankophonen Afrika. Letztere fordern bereits mehr politische und wirtschaftliche Souver\\u00e4nit\\u00e4t, beispielsweise in Bezug auf die zunehmend anachronistische F CFA-W\\u00e4hrung. Angesichts des fehlenden Gegengewichtes Gro\\u00dfbritanniens in der EU im Falle des Austritts, k\\u00f6nnte das korrupte Netzwerk des \\u201aFran\\u00e7afrique\\u2018 au\\u00dferdem wiederbelebt und konsolidiert werden. Schlie\\u00dflich k\\u00f6nnte der Brexit auch die m\\u00fchsam erk\\u00e4mpften Menschenrechte sowohl in Europa als auch in Afrika negativ beeinflussen. Denn beim Brexit wurden bislang Auswirkungen auf die gemeinsam geteilte Ethik weitgehend au\\u00dfer Acht gelassen. Tats\\u00e4chlich stellt der Brexit einen R\\u00fcckschritt bei der F\\u00f6rderung eines humanen politischen und soziokulturellen Klimas dar. Letzteres droht sich eher in Richtung eines Apartheid S\\u00fcdafrika zu entwickeln, eingeschlossen der Verfolgung ultranationalistischer Ziele und der Schw\\u00e4chung etablierten Menschenrechte, beispielsweise hinsichtlich wachsender Ungleichheit und des Kreuzzugs gegen \\u201aUngl\\u00e4ubige\\u2018 und Au\\u00dfenstehende. Generell wird der Brexit au\\u00dferdem negative Auswirkungen auf die partizipative Ethik haben, sowohl in Europa als auch in Afrika.\",\n",

Nigella sativa (Black seed) is a \\nwidely researched medicinal plant with numerous reported therapeutic activities in humans and \\nrodents. Being the most abundant neurotransmitter in Drosophila, glutamate plays an important \\nrole in learning and memory, neuro-excitation but also neuro-inhibition. This research thus \\ninvestigated the impacts of Nigella sativa on the survival rate, glutamate level and negative \\ngeotactical abilities in Harwich strains of Drosophila melanogaster. The experimental flies were \\nexposed to varied concentrations of Nigella sativa oil for five days. The results showed a higher \\nsurvival rate, glutamate level and negative geotactic ability for the lower dose flies, while the \\nhigher Nigella sativa dose flies recorded significantly lesser values in the trio. This indicates that \\nNigella sativa administered at 2.4ml/4ml (60%) of feed may be lethal to the general survival and \\nphysiological functions of adult Drosophila.

This brings in diversity in levels of language and learning ability and universities face the challenge of adjusting their curricula to meet the academic needs of the different learners. The objective of this paper is to document the experiences of students and teachers on a course that was introduced to address student diversity and integrative learning in a higher institution of learning.\\nMethods \\nThe course was evaluated through two ways. Firstly, a student feedback questionnaire was administered to 250 students at the end of the first and second semesters during the first two years of introduction of the course. Secondly, students\\u2019 reflections were extracted from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions during the 4th and 5th years of implementation of the course. \\nResults\\nDue to the diversity in entry level learning and language skills, some units of the course were not rated favourably by about 50% of the students who struggled to see the relevance. However, many students\\u2019 experiences with the value of the course in enabling integrative learning were positive. Some students reported that they acquired lifelong skills in critical thinking and problem solving. \\nConclusion \\nThis paper demonstrates that a course that focusses on helping students to integrate learning is invaluable. Further research is required on the types of strategies and how to implement them to meet the varied needs of students from diverse backgrounds.\",\n",

When one\\nvisits some institutions of higher learning as well as hospitals outside the shores of Africa, one\\ndiscovers that experts in various fields working in them are from Africa. One of the things\\nmigration of the young from Africa to Europe and America has taught us is that African children\\ncan compete favourably with their European and American counterparts when placed under the\\nsame condition. Hence, it is not that Africans are not gifted intellectually, they are but African's\\nintellectual prowess has not been adequately harnessed as a result of the actions and inactions of\\ntheir leaders.

When such leaders are on seat, the destinies of their citizens are daily suppressed\\nknowingly or unknowingly. This study aims at showing that African underdevelopment lies in the\\nhands of selfish and sit-tight leaders. Jesus in the above chapter and verses of Matthew urges that\\nanyone who will present himself to be a leader must be the servant of others. The desire of a\\nservant leader centers on how to help all citizens realize their destinies. This study adopted the\\nhistorical critical exegesis as well as library research as her methodology to arrive at her\\nconclusions. This study argues that if present crop of leaders in Africa were to be selfless and\\ncharismatic, Africa will be the envy of the whole world.

Mostly, election is done so as to avert constitutional crisis. Such an election is always successful to the admiration and acceptability of all and sundry when the majority have sincere heart and intention and working selflessly towards communal wellbeing. Admiration and acceptability of any electoral outcome depend solely on the faithful observance of laid down criteria for the said election. Compromise of any electoral criteria (law) gives room for outright rejection of results which may eventually leads to anarchy if not properly managed by the court of the said land. Election of Matthias in Acts 1:12-26 shows oneness of purpose, and willingness to follow a laid down criteria for anyone who would replace the impaired disciple. The criteria suggested two qualified candidates. Eventually, Matthias was unanimously elected and admirably accepted. The aim of this paper is to show that the majority of the electoral outcome that are rejected and contested in court are those the criteria that led to them were highly compromised. The paper argues that if Nigerians were to respect her electoral laws in every election then there will be little or no suit challenging the outcome of such elections in court. Significantly, the outcome of this work will benefit all Nigerians and indeed all nations of the world. The method we shall employ is exegesis of Acts 1:12-26 and library research.\",\n",

Venture capital (VC) can fill this funding gap and has emerged as an important global source of growth capital. While VC can help grow African businesses, our understanding of VC activities in Africa remains limited. Sparse research has limited the ability of small business owners to expand their financing options. We use a sample of 120 VC funds that primarily invest in Africa to investigate trends in the growth of VC activities in Africa, as well as to examine the associations between VC fundraising and micro-level firm variables between 2000-2018. We find that at least $4.57b of VC funding has been raised during this period by African VC funds. We observe that most funds keep diversified portfolios and invest in businesses at various stages of growth, and that funds prefer to keep their investment activities within domiciled countries. Using a multiple linear regression model, we find significant associations between VC fundraising and VC fund type, location focus, and vintage year. We do not find any associations between VC fundraising and industry focus, fund manager domicile or fundraising target size. These findings are important because small businesses can better assess their funding options, VC firms can update their strategies, and policy makers can update their policy priorities.\",\n",

            "  \"description\": \"Africa is one of the three key regions of deep convection in the global tropics. There is a wealth of information on the intensity, variability and change of convection and associated rainfall in regions across the continent but almost all of this literature is regionally focused and confined to specific seasons. This fragmented approach precludes a continent-wide view of deep convection leaving the following key issues unanswered: When is deep convection the most wide-spread across Africa? Where does wide-spread convection have the most interannual variability? Where are the centres of most intense local convection? This paper confronts these questions using a satellite-derived integral of deep convection. At the continental scale, late austral summer \\u2013 especially March \\u2013 exhibits the most extensive and intense convection while the West African monsoon during June-July exhibits the least. El Ni\\u02dcno amplifies (La Ni\\u02dcna reduces) the disparity between the March peak and July minima. These pan-African signals are largely determined by regional hotspots: the eastern Congo hosts the most persistently intense convection; southeastern southern Africa displays the highest interannual variability; regional highlands maintain local convective activity hotspots. Furthermore, pan-African annual mean convective activity has increase ~10% between 1983 and 2015 with increases of &gt;20% recorded in local hotspots. Results in this study provide a climatological baseline for both observational and model-based studies of African climates and offer insights into when African convection has the greatest potential impact on the general circulation.\",\n",

In order to assign functional roles to the multiplicity of languages, the Federal Government promulgated the National Policy on Education (henceforth NPE) in 1977 stipulated that every Nigerian child must be proficient in his mother tongue and in a major Nigerian language. At the secondary level, it is expected that every child should be bilingual in two Nigerian languages. Thirty six years later, the impact of the policy on the language education of Nigerian pupils was assessed. Data were collected using questionnaire and interview methods. Findings revealed that the primary aim of the NPE has not been achieved. Based on the findings, the recommendation made include the organization of intensive workshop sessions for language teachers to expose them to the modern techniques for attaining bilingualism through effective training.\",\n",

By contrast, in Tashlhiyt, a Berber language, words can be composed entirely of voiceless segments. When an utterance consists of such words, the phonetic opportunity for the execution of intonational pitch movements is exceptionally limited. This book explores in a series of production and perception experiments how these typologically rare phonotactic patterns interact with intonational aspects of linguistic structure. It turns out that Tashlhiyt allows for a tremendously flexible placement of tonal events. Observed intonational structures can be conceived of as different solutions to a functional dilemma: The requirement to realise meaningful pitch movements in certain positions and the extent to which segments lend themselves to a clear manifestation of these pitch movements.\",\n",

We go further to study the outcomes when both sets consist of the same symbols and when they consist of different symbols. We identify this form of permutation as 'second-order permutation' and show that it has a corresponding unique factorial which plays a prominent role in most of the results obtained. This has been discovered by examining many practical problems which give rise to the emergence of second-order permutation. Upon examination of these problems, it becomes clear that a directly higher order of permutation exist. Hence this study aims at equipping mathematics scholars, educators and researchers with the necessary background knowledge and framework for incorporating second-order permutation into the field of combinatorial mathematics.\",\n",

The site is known for large surface assemblages of later Acheulean lithics such as hand axes, cleavers, scrapers, and cores. While hominin remains have yet to be discovered at the site, Isimila offers a unique window into Middle Pleistocene Homo behavior. Although Isimila has been studied extensively, the last published map of the site and surrounding area was made available in the 1970s. Here, we present an updated high-resolution map of Isimila. Data for the map were collected during aerial survey with an uncrewed/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). With this map, we identify new archaeological localities, erosional patterns, newly exposed geological features, and changes in site topography. The map reveals patterns of stone tool and raw material distribution that may support previous hypotheses of raw material transport into the area by hominins. This open-access map establishes a baseline for tracking changes to site topography in the future and serves as a unique tool to enable collaboration between researchers, museum personnel, and local populations to better conserve Isimila.\",\n",

            "  \"description\": \"Open Science is becoming increasingly popular globally and provides unprecedented opportunities for scientists in Africa, South East Asia, and Latin America. African scientists face several difficulties when attempting to get their work published in peer reviewed journals -there is a small number of publication platforms, a lack of knowledge and access difficulties related to existing journals, whose visibility on the web is not very good (Piron et al., 2017). There are also obstacles related to the functioning of the journals themselves (notably the duration of the revision process and the cost of publications) and the result is that science and scholarly publishing are often perceived as a prerogative of the Northern countries. The methods and techniques (including the peer review process) that are being developed for its dissemination are not necessarily adapted to the contexts of other regions of the world, including Africa. Indeed, many African-based peer-reviewed scholarly journals are unable to host their content online due to resource limitations and the digital divide (Agaba et al., 2004). In this article, we provide an overview of the most important initiatives and actors in the Open Science movement in Africa. We further identify three major challenges for Open Science on the African continent and offer perspectives for African researchers to actively contribute to the global scientific community and share knowledge to meet the challenges we all face.                     \\n\\nR\\u00e9sum\\u00e9\\nLe mouvement de la Science Ouverte est de plus en plus populaire dans le monde et offre des opportunit\\u00e9s sans pr\\u00e9c\\u00e9dent aux scientifiques en Afrique, en Asie du Sud-Est et en Am\\u00e9rique latine. Les scientifiques africains font face \\u00e0 plusieurs difficult\\u00e9s lorsqu'ils tentent de faire publier leurs travaux dans des revues \\u00e9valu\\u00e9es par des pairs - il existe en effet un petit nombre de plateformes de publication, un manque de connaissances et des difficult\\u00e9s d'acc\\u00e8s li\\u00e9es aux revues existantes, dont la visibilit\\u00e9 sur le Web n'est pas tr\\u00e8s bonne (Piron et al., 2017). Il y a aussi des obstacles li\\u00e9s au fonctionnement des revues elles-m\\u00eames (notamment la dur\\u00e9e du processus de r\\u00e9vision et le co\\u00fbt des publications) ; il en r\\u00e9sulte donc que la science et la publication scientifique sont souvent per\\u00e7ues comme une pr\\u00e9rogative des pays du Nord. Les m\\u00e9thodes et techniques (y compris le processus d'examen par les pairs) qui sont mises au point pour sa diffusion ne sont pas n\\u00e9cessairement adapt\\u00e9es au contexte d'autres r\\u00e9gions du monde, dont l'Afrique. En effet, de nombreuses revues savantes africaines \\u00e9valu\\u00e9es par des pairs ne sont pas en mesure d'h\\u00e9berger leur contenu en ligne en raison des ressources limit\\u00e9es dont elles disposent et de la fracture num\\u00e9rique (Agaba et al., 2004). Dans cet article, nous fournissons un aper\\u00e7u des initiatives et des acteurs les plus importants du mouvement de la Science Ouverte en Afrique. Nous identifions en outre trois d\\u00e9fis majeurs pour la Science Ouverte sur le continent africain et pr\\u00e9sentons des perspectives pour les chercheurs africains pour contribuer activement \\u00e0 la communaut\\u00e9 scientifique mondiale et partager les connaissances afin relever les d\\u00e9fis auxquels nous sommes tous confront\\u00e9s.\\n\\n\\nLakotan\\nIm\\u1ecd Im\\u1ecd ti wa ni agbaye ti o gbajumo jul\\u1ecd ni agbaye ati pese aw\\u1ecdn anfani ti ko dara fun aw\\u1ecdn onimo ijinl\\u1eb9 sayensi ni Afirika, Ila-oorun Iw\\u1ecd-oorun ati Latin America.

We aimed to assess this association in Cameroonian mothers.\\nMethods: We used a case-control design. Cases were women diagnosed with arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease between 2012 and 2017 at the General and the Gyneco-obstetric hospital of Yaound\\u00e9. Controls were mothers of children who seeked pediatric care at the Gyneco-obstetric hospital of Yaound\\u00e9, with no diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.  We abstracted data from patient files to assess cardiovascular disease, and used phone-based questionnaires to assess prior history of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy. We used logistic regression and propensity scores for adjustment. Results: Out of 1228 individuals selected, 173 cases and 339 controls participated in the study. We found no increased risk of cardiovascular diseases for women with a history of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (OR = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.34). Women with gestational hypertension had 2.33 (95% CI, 0.99 to 5.50) times the risk of women with no history of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy, an inverse association was observed between preeclampsia and cardiovascular diseases (OR = 0.28, 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.72). Conclusions: Cameroonian women with a history of gestational hypertension may have an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, population-based studies with more accurate data on the exposure are needed.\",\n",

            "  \"description\": \"Poultry farming is very important sector in Tanzania because it improves the human health and when sold provides income, it supports the livelihoods of 3.7 million households in Tanzania. Poultry farming sector is facing a challenge of lack of market information, also absence of well-coordinated system which is harmonized between stakeholders. Both poultry farmers and buyers rely on informal market information. The findings form this study shows that key market information required by poultry farmers and buyers are price, buyer or farmer location, Poultry kilograms, amount of poultry needed by buyers, amount of poultry products needed by buyers, types of poultry needed by buyers and kind of poultry products needed by buyers. This paper discusses this key market information required by poultry farmers and buyers, also the challenges faced due to lack of market information. In order to disseminate the identified market information requirements and to overcome the mentioned challenges the web based platform has been proposed as a solution to overcome the market information gap.\",\n",

            "  \"description\": \"Poultry farming has a very good business potential (Mohammad Khairu Islam, Mohammed Forhad Uddin, 2014) since they are fast growing animals meaning the business has potential to generate high return on investment under a short period of time. For example past days it took about four months for a chicken to become two kilograms, however these days a two kilogram chicken can be produced within 42 days (Hamra, 2010).  Despite the fact that poultry farming has good business potential there are some obstacles which hinder the poultry business success such as lack of market linkage. Even with advancement of technology which has brought affordable smartphones to most of the livestock farmers, potential livestock information systems in Tanzania are used by very few livestock farmers and some are not used at all (Mussa et al., 2016). It is not that users do not need the system, nor the system does not show any potential for them, but depend on its usability and how well it suited to the user requirements based on their differences. Users of the system have a lot of differences including exposure to technology (Kalimullah &amp; Sushmitha, 2017).   It is now as more important than ever that web applications provide a good user experience which was once considered luxury or an added expenses (Juan, 2014; Ross, 2014).  Web based platform for reliable market linkage has been developed with more focus on usability and user experience design. Eye tracking method combined with retrospective think aloud method and facial expression was used to test user experience of the developed web application. The result shows that users were emotionally happy when performing the second and the third tasks. But when performing the first task and the last task users were emotionally anxiety and disappointed.\",\n",

Competition has been\\nobserved over time as a phenomenon that has helped people achieve the very best of their potentials in their various fields. Competition has also helped individuals achieve feats they would not have ordinarily achieved as they are pushed beyond their limits. The same can also be said of cooperation and collaboration, which can be used to achieve specific goals or objectives. Hence, both competition and collaboration can be vital in creating a healthy learning process among students. This paper discusses a competitive and collaborative platform on\\nthe learning process for two selected online courses in Electrical Engineering. Using a platform developed in LabVIEW programming language, a community of students were encouraged to compete online as they try to reduce block diagrams of subsystems in Control Engineering as well as reduce given Series-Parallel Resistor Circuits in the shortest time and amount of steps possible. At the end of each trial, students can view the finish time of other students and can share, online, their individual solutions with the community as well as discuss ideas such as reduction techniques they find most expedient via a public online notepad. This creates a means of learning from the community. The platform helps to passively induce a competitive and collaborative perspective in the learning pathway of students, thereby improving the interest and experience of students in the selected subject areas. The platform uses an online server to maintain communications from all the students in their various locations. Students can view the timed performance of their counterparts on a leadership board thereby engendering induced competition in the learning community. The instructor or administrator can also monitor activities in the community from a server portal.\",\n",

            "  \"description\": \"This paper presents a basic laboratory training module aimed at helping undergraduate students understand the interfacing and connectivity issues involved in the Internet of things (IoT). The training module uses a sequential teaching approach to draft quasi-experiments for teaching basic IoT concepts. Interfacing includes identification, embedded sensing and embedded actuating while connectivity includes wireless connectivity and web/ mobile services. An IoT function (control and/or measurement) is first selected by users based on the physical variable of interest and the action to be carried out. The user will also select a connectivity option based on network types and transmission technologies available for communication between a sensor and/or an actuator and a gateway. The available connectivity options in this work are Bluetooth and RF. An interface is then setup based on the choices made using Arduino Pro Mini as microcontroller. Arduino Yun and a smartphone are the available gateway options depending on the connectivity option of the interface. When Bluetooth is the connectivity type on the\\ninterface, the smartphone is used as gateway while Arduino Yun serves as the gateway when RF is the connectivity option on the interface. The training module is accompanied with an instruction manual which contains instructions on the set ups and short notes on signals and\\nsystems, Analog to Digital Converters (ADC), Digital to Analog Converters (DAC), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), etc. The training module was tested with 100 randomly selected students. A few students had problems setting up the interface correctly. Coding the Arduino boards was a challenge for some of the students while a few others had challenges with creating sensor nodes. Choosing the correct connectivity type to match a gateway was the most challenging for the students.\",\n",

Christa Kuljian\\u2019s real triumph in this book is that she reframes the narrative of palaeoanthropological discovery in South Africa as a tale of flawed men who succeed \\u2013 through some combination of luck, skill, personality and perseverance \\u2013 literally and figuratively on the backs of black bodies. That she tells this story with limited cynicism and anger is a testament to the author. This book takes a rich, personal, archivally-intensive and interview-based look at the history of palaeoanthropology that is uncommon in our field, focussing on a region of the world where the global context of racism and the eugenics movement in the 20th century was further compounded by state-sanctioned apartheid. It is a timely tale of racism and misogyny and how they shape scientists, the scientific enterprise, and narratives of human origins and evolution. Although a large portion of this book is historical, it brings the reader right up to the present, and contains themes that remain relevant today, in the age of #BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo, and other pertinent movements, and affect our field more generally. \\nIn this review, I will first provide a very brief summary of the book. I will then highlight what I believe are the book\\u2019s most salient themes that are relevant to biological anthropology today: racism in science, intersectionality, and the invalid (but still prevalent) idea that scientists and their work can be separated. Finally, I will consider current practice in palaeoanthropology, as well as various reviews of the book, in order to reflect on these issues.\",\n",

However, the dynamics of this genetic exchange and associated phenotypic consequences through time remain poorly understood. Gene exchange across divergent lineages can result in myriad outcomes arising from these dynamics and the environmental conditions under which it occurs. Here we draw from our collective research across various organisms, illustrating some of the ways in which gene exchange can structure genomic/phenotypic diversity within/among species.  We present a range of examples relevant to questions about the evolution of hominins.  These examples are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather illustrative of the diverse evolutionary causes/consequences of hybridization, highlighting potential drivers of human evolution in the context of hybridization including: influences on adaptive evolution, climate change, developmental systems, sex-differences in behavior, Haldane\\u2019s rule and the large X-effect, and transgressive phenotypic variation.\",\n",

Since 1981, the incidence of cervical cancer has been on the rise among women living with HIV/AIDS. Cervical cancer in Uganda is usually diagnosed late and the prognosis is very poor. There are gaps in general knowledge on cervical cancer (CC) screening and availability of screening services in the country. This study is intended to explore such barriers to access and utilization of cervical cancer screening services among WHIV in Kyenjojo District\\nMethodology\\nWe will search publications and written articles on cervical cancer prevention especially screening among HIV women, from PubMed, Cochrane libraries, as well as the ministry of health unpublished reports. We will employ a qualitative study design using key informant (KI) purposively selected from Kyenjojo Hospital Reproductive Health and ART Clinics. This will permit us to achieve a detailed investigation using health belief model on individual perceptions while providing deeper insights into the factors that hinder access and utilization of cervical cancer screening services among HIV/AIDS women in Kyenjojo District. \\nConclusion\\nThis study is intended to explore such barriers to access and utilization of cervical cancer screening services among WHIV in Kyenjojo. The study will thus significantly contribute to improved programming, advocacy, and efforts to scale up CC services among rural populations in Uganda while contributing to overall maternal survival in line with 2030 Sustainable Development Goals country initiatives\",\n",

Access to HIV services remains low among this group although several effective interventions have been documented. It is therefore important to identify what has worked well to increase the reach of HIV services among MSM.\\nMethods: We searched MEDLINE, POPLINE and the Web of Science databases to collect published articles reporting HIV interventions among MSM across sub-Saharan Africa. Covidence was used to review the articles. The review protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) - CRD42017060808.\\nResults: The search identified 2627 citations, and following removal of duplicates and inclusion and exclusion criteria,\\nonly 15 papers were eligible for inclusion in the review. The articles reported various accrual strategies, namely: respondent-driven sampling, known peers identified through hotspot or baseline surveys, engagement with existing community-based organizations, and through peer educators contacting MSM in virtual sites. Some programs, however, combined some of these accrual strategies. Peer-led outreach services were indicated to reach and deliver services to more MSM. A combination of peer outreach and mobile clinics increased uptake of health information and services. Health facilities, especially MSM-friendly facilities attract access and use of services by MSM and retention into care.\\nConclusions: There are various strategies for accrual and delivering services to MSM across SSA. However, each of these strategies have specific strengths and weaknesses necessitating combinations of interventions and integration of the specific context to inform implementation. If the best of intervention content and implementation are used to inform these services, sufficient coverage and impact of HIV prevention and treatment programs for MSM across SSA can be optimized.\\nKeywords: HIV intervention, Accrual, Delivery, Men who have sex with men, sub-Saharan Africa\",\n",

            "  \"description\": \"In their seminal works on postcolonialism, Edward Sa\\u00efd (in Orientalism) and V.Y. Mudimbe (in The Idea of Africa) proposed that Asia and Africa, respectively, were constructs created around the notion of their otherness. Both regions were viewed as infantile, primitive, and homogenous entities that fell outside the domain of civilized (i.e. Western) humanity. These constructs shaped scientific perceptions of both continents over the course of several centuries and have continued to be operative over the last 100 years following the discovery of fossil human ancestors, particularly within the narratives of recent human origins. Here we reflect on these narratives, both in the early days of the discoveries and more recently, in the context of the othered identities of the continents more broadly. We argue that a colonialist socio-political framework has shaped the science of human origins since its inception, and that this has negatively affected the quality of this endeavour. Existing phylogenies cannot be divorced from those ideologies\\u2014even today. Indeed, while the details of human origins (e.g. when, where, who) have changed radically over time, the narrative that emerged always left one group in control, and marginalised non-Western lands and their peoples, leaving the ordering of superior and inferior more or less unchanged through the history of the discipline. More informed models of human evolution cannot be constructed until the community of voices constructing them is reworked to be more inclusive of many worldviews.\",\n",

Different classes of radio galaxies can be used as tracers of the cosmic environment, including the dark matter density field, to address key cosmological questions. Classifying these galaxies based on morphology is thus an important step toward achieving the science goals of next generation radio surveys. Radio galaxies have been traditionally classified as Fanaroff-Riley (FR) I and II, although some exhibit more complex 'bent' morphologies arising from environmental factors or intrinsic properties. In this work we present the FIRST Classifier, an on-line system for automated classification of Compact and Extended radio sources. We developed the FIRST Classifier based on a trained Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model to automate the morphological classification of com- pact and extended radio sources observed in the FIRST radio survey. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 97% and a recall of 98%, 100%, 98% and 93% for Compact, BENT, FRI and FRII galaxies respectively. The current version of the FIRST classifier is able to identify the morphological class for a single source or for a list of sources as Compact or Extended (FRI, FRII and BENT).\",\n",

In Uganda, adolescents are the most vulnerable group as far as HIV epidemic is concerned. Mass media awareness campaigns play a key role in promoting sexual and reproductive health among adolescents. Using Uganda\\u2019s 2016 Demographic Health Survey, we examine the causal effect of mass media exposure on the probability of adolescents getting an HIV test and their HIV-related knowledge. Our results suggest that the exposure to mass media increases both adolescents\\u2019 likelihood to get tested for HIV and their HIV-related knowledge score. In fact, we find that reading newspapers once a week increases the likelihood of an adolescent to test for HIV by 6.29 percentage points. Listening to radio once a week increases the probability to test for HIV by 4.57 percentage points. This effect increases to 6.56 percentage points when the adolescent listens to the radio more than once a week. Watching TV more than once a week increases adolescents\\u2019 probability to get tested for HIV by 8.57 percentage points. For HIV-related knowledge, we find that compared to adolescents who do not read newspapers at all, adolescents who read newspapers less than once a week and those who read newspapers at least once a week have a higher score of HIV-related knowledge of 9.12% and 9.64% respectively. Compared to adolescents who do not listen to radio at all, adolescents who listen to radio less than once a week have a higher (5.88%) score of HIV related knowledge. Moreover, listening to radio at least once a week increases the score of HIV-related knowledge by 5.52%. Hence, mass media awareness campaigns are important policies to promote HIV testing and HIV-related knowledge among adolescents in Uganda.\",\n",

            "  \"description\": \"Improved crops are advocated to meet the dual challenge of food security and the fight against poverty in developing countries. As most poor people in developing countries live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihood, an important key to get them out of poverty is to increase agricultural productivity by using technologies such as improved crops. However, the rate of improved crops adoption remains surprisingly low in Niger, one of the world poorest countries. In this paper, we examine the factors affecting adoption of improved crops by rural farmers focusing on Niger. Using the 2014\\u2019s National Survey on Households Living Conditions and Agriculture, we investigate the effect of farmers\\u2019 socioeconomic characteristics, the farm\\u2019s quality, the geographic location, the production system, the access to improved seeds and the land tenure on the probability to use improved crops rather than local crops. Our results suggest that the ownership of a government land title is the most important driver in the adoption of improved crops by rural farmers. In addition, being a female, educated, practicing polyculture, having access to improved seed increase the probability to adopt improved crops. In contrast, household size, operating on the parcel for a long period and the parcel size reduces the probability to use improved crops. These determinants of improved crops adoption should be considered in Niger\\u2019s agricultural policy to succeed in the dissemination of improved crops among rural farmers.\",\n",

            "  \"description\": \"Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) still raise serious concerns for adolescents\\u2019 sexual health in west-African\\ndeveloping countries. To this extent, promoting contraception use among sexually active adolescents is a major key to addressing this problem. Yet, the rate of contraception use by adolescents remains surprisingly low in these countries. Using the Demographic Health Survey of Burkina Faso (2014) and Nigeria (2013), this paper examines the influence of school education on contraception use among sexually active male and female\\nadolescents aged 15-19 in Burkina Faso and Nigeria. The standard estimates using Probit regressions suggest\\nthat achieving a primary school education increases the probability of a sexually active adolescent to use\\ncontraception by 8.26 percentage points (Burkina Faso) and 17.2 percentage points (Nigeria). This effect\\nincreases to 20.3 percentage points (Burkina Faso) and 34.7 percentage points (Nigeria) for adolescents with a\\nsecondary or higher school education. However, these baseline estimates are biased because adolescents\\u2019\\ndecision to engage into sexual activity is not random. In light of this, a Heckman Correction Model (HCM) has\\nbeen applied to account for this selection bias. The results show that the Probit regressions underestimate the\\neffect of education on adolescents\\u2019 likelihood to use contraception in Burkina Faso and overestimate this effect in Nigeria. In fact, compared to adolescents with no school education, HCM estimates show that adolescents\\nwith primary and secondary (or higher) school education have respectively 10.2 and 24.4 percentage points more\\nin the use of contraception in Burkina Faso and 15.1 and 34 percentage points in Nigeria. Together, these results\\nsuggest that the exposure to school education increases contraception use among the adolescents in both Burkina\\nFaso and Nigeria.\",\n",

In particular, this is realizable only for a vanishing  microscopic value of the dimensionless cosmological constant at the asymptotically safe fixed point. To accommodate a nonzero infrared value of the cosmological constant, we consider the linearized Renormalization Group flow away from the fixed point, which is characterized by two critical exponents in the Einstein-Hilbert truncation. In this study, we show that the realization of a regular de-Sitter core  places a bound on the universal gravitational critical  exponents. Accordingly, our study hints at the possibility of  singularity resolution in black holes, as explicit estimates of  the critical exponents in the literature point towards a realization of our bound.\",\n",

Indeed, it is difficult to equate our modern intellectual condition with deep past biological indicators at all.  Nonetheless, arguably the best and most visible evidence for biological changes that might be precursors to these abilities are in the form of increasing complexity and/or novelty. We see these patterns in the hominin fossil record most strongly at the emergence and diversification of our genus, and in the Middle to Late Pleistocene record with the emergence of our species.  Here we will first give a brief overview of the human fossil record, and will then focus on these two time periods, and the question of what produces such complexity/novelty.\",\n",

            "  \"description\": \"Several challenges contribute to Africa\\u2019s trailing position in the global production of knowledge. Decades of focused work through international and local programmes have thus far been unable to lift the continent onto its scientific feet. To learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of neuroscience research carried out on the continent today, that would enable the development of robust programmes focusing on specific needs, a strategy is required to extract information about specific contributions of African laboratories. Nigeria, Africa\\u2019s most populous nation, is among the top beneficiaries of international programmes promoting neuroscience research in Africa. Therefore, to establish and test a framework for evaluating neuroscience output from the continent, we here focussed on Nigeria\\u2019s neuroscience publications over the past two decades. Using PubMed key-word search and defined exclusion criteria, we extracted 572 neuroscience articles from Nigeria-based laboratories published between 1996 and 2017. Articles were automatically categorised into clinical and epidemiological studies (55.5%) or basic neuroscience (44.5%) using a support vector machine and decision tree algorithm. From here, we extracted each publication\\u2019s use of model species, methods, citations received and the publishing journal\\u2019s metrics.\\nWe find that over the 21 year period surveyed, only one Nigerian-led neuroscience paper was published in a \\u201ctop-tier\\u201d international journal with an impact factor of &gt;8. However, about half (55%) of PubMed indexed articles were published in reputable journals with an impact factor between 1-4. These publications primarily comprised basic (61%), rather than clinical and epidemiological studies (39%) which were instead mostly published in lower-ranking journals. Next, we find a worrying account of model species and research tools employed in Nigerian-based neuroscience. For example, no studies used genetically amenable model systems such as zebrafish, Drosophila, C.elegans, or transgenic mouse strains. Instead, popular model species were human (54%), rat (30%) and wild-type mice (11%). In line, research techniques employed were dominated by \\u201cbasic\\u201d techniques such as Hematoxylin and Eosin stainings or classical behavioural analysis, with only 8% of studies using more modern techniques like PCR, Western blotting or forms of fluorescence microscopy. Perhaps as one consequence, even though medicinal plants have been used to treat diseases for decades by locals, and 41% of basic neuroscience studies investigated their potential utility in treating disease, none made it into local clinical research.\\nTogether, these findings highlight two clear access points for the support of Nigerian neuroscience in the future: Investment in the training and infrastructure in the use of more modern research techniques, and the widespread promotion of genetically amenable model species. Moreover, any such effort might consider specifically targeting existing basic over clinical or epidemiological research efforts. In time, it will be important to also assess the neuroscience output across the entire continent.\",\n",

The majority of pregnancies occur between the ages of 15 and 17 (54.19%) in seconde and the 5th classes of secondary school.
