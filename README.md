# Developing an African repository for scholarly communication
- owned by the African Science community
- hosted on African territory
- open source
- open access
- free for users


## Vision
African research output should be owned and hosted on African territory. We therefore propose an African repository for preprint uploads as well as the aggregation of African research output including: 
- scholarly books 
- journal articles 
- List of digital African scholarly journals 
- …

The repository database will be hosted by African research institutions in each of the 5 regions on the continent. To achieve this we will build a decentralized infrastructure with the following features:
- Core database hosted on a server at an African institution
- Mirror backup of the database to servers in all African regions (EastA, WestA, NorthA, CentralA) and a Cloud 
- Ensuring African ownership of African research output
- possibly incl. blockchain components
- …


### two (2) components
- ensuring maximum discoverability and interoperability

preprint repository | aggregator 
--- | --- 
upload of preprint manuscripts, student reports, research proposals, registered reports/preregistrations, short communications, etc. | aggregating scholarly output from and about Africa via one interface inlc preprints form toher platforms, scholarly books, datasets for streamlined discoverability
based on PKP OPS (?) | via API of partner platforms
DOI and CC-BY 4.0 attribution | …
integration with Crossref, ORCID, … | …


## Required features 
- login (via email / affiliation / ORCID / Github / …)
- document upload
- document versioning with time stamp and archiving of all versions under one doi
- licensing (CC-BY 4.0 and others to choose from incl. all commonly used academic licenses, i.e. MIT, GNU, CC-BY-…, …)
- Indexing via Google Scholar, OpenAIR, PubMed, …

- entry mask to add authors, affiliations, tags, keywords, title, abstract, lay summary
- interoperability with other existing repositories
- Discipline (categories) and keywords search


## Languages
- machine translations of languages commonly spoken on the continet 
- machine translations with options/overlay interface to manually improve the text online (see www.GTranslate.io) // GoogleTranspate API
- Language switch // editable by the users and admin


## integrations
- ORCID // https://members.orcid.org/cc-publishers
- CrossREF
- Altmetrics
- GoogleDrive
- Dropbox
- DSpace
- OSF
- Open Knowledge Maps (BASE search)


## SOFTWARE OPTIONS
- PKP Open Preprint Systems (OPS)
- ? https://www.u-repo.io/
- ? 


## Server space
Identify at least one (1) host institutions in each African region that can host the AfricArXiv database.
What capacity is needed in the beginning and projected over the next 3-5 years?

# Connect via cloud services
Make sure that the provider has a server based in Africa. Database must be easy to migrate if needed.
Current cloud options:
- Microsoft Azure’s services // already in SA
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) // announced to open servers in Africa
- Google Cloud // announced to open servers in Africa
