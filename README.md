## Server space
Identify potential hosting institutions in each African region that can host AfricArXiv physically for a few years.
What capacity is needec in the beginning and projected over the next 3-5 years?


## Cloud services
Make sure that the provider has a server based in Africa. Database must be easy to migrate if needed.
Current cloud options:
- Microsoft Azure’s services // already in SA
