# Developing an African repository for scholarly communication
- open source
- open access
- free for users // primarily African scientists

## Vision
African research output should be owned and hosted on African territory. We therefore propose an African repository for preprint uploads as well as the aggregation of African research output including: 
- scholarly books 
- journal articles 
- List of digital African scholarly journals 
- …

The repository database will be hosted by African research institutions in each of the 5 regions on the continent. To achieve this we will build a decentralized infrastructure with the following features:
- Core database hosted on a server at an African institution
- Mirror backup of the database to servers in all African regions (EastA, WestA, NorthA, CentralA)
- Ensuring African ownership of African research output
- incl. blockchain components
- …


## Required features for the respository
- login (via email / affiliation / ORCID / Github / …)
- document upload
- document versioning with time stamp and archiving of all versions under one doi
- licensing (CC-BY 4.0 and others to choose from incl. all commonly used academic licenses, i.e. MIT, GNU, CC-BY-…, …)

- entry mask to add authors, affiliations, tags, keywords, title, abstract, lay summary
- interoperability with other existing repositories
- Discipline (categories) and keywords search


## Languages
- machine translations languages c0mmonly spken on the continet 
- machine translations with options/overlay interface to manually improve the text online (see www.GTranslate.io) // GoogleTranspate API
- Language switch // editable by the users and admin


## integrations
- ORCID // https://members.orcid.org/cc-publishers
- CrossREF
- Altmetrics
- GoogleDrive
- Dropbox
- DSpace
- OSF
- Open Knowledge Maps (BASE search)


## Server space
Identify potential hosting institutions in each African region that can host AfricArXiv physically for a few years.
What capacity is needec in the beginning and projected over the next 3-5 years?


## Cloud services
Make sure that the provider has a server based in Africa. Database must be easy to migrate if needed.
Current cloud options:
- Microsoft Azure’s services // already in SA
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) // announced to open servers in Africa
- Google Cloud // announced to open servers in Africa

### Expenses
- cloud server space
- third party integration service fees
- running server costs: costs for data upload and maintenance by third parties
- internal HR overhead - tech dev & maintenance
